# Servo-Motor-with-Raspi-JS

## Introduction
This will be the repository for the Raspberry pi running Johnny-five script containing simple servo motor control code using toggle switch.

## Why did I made this?
For the final project in our class.

## Materials needed
- Raspberry Pi (at least 3 Model B)
- Servo Motor (a small one will do)
- Relay
- Toggle Switch (SPDT)
- Male-to-Female Jumping Wires
- Small Breadboard

## Connections
- Refer to the Pin Information here: https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-io/wiki/Pin-Information
- Connect the DC IN and GND of both the servo motor and the toggle switch to the appropriate 5V and GND GPIO ports of the Pi

## To run
- Turn on pi, and run.
